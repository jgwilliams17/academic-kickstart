abstract = "This paper considers the significant role of cross-sectional geometry on resistance in coaxial pipe flows. We consider an axially flowing viscous fluid in between two long and thin elliptical coaxial cylinders, one inside the other. The outer cylinder is stationary, while the inner cylinder (or rod) is free to move. The inner rod thus poses a resistance to the axial flow, while the viscous fluid poses a resistance to any motion of the inner rod. The objective of this paper is to characterise the nature of these resistances and how they depend on the cross-sectional geometry. We show that the equations for flow in the axial direction by a prescribed flux -- and for flow within the cross-section of the domain -- driven by the motion of the rod -- decouple in the asymptotic limit of small cylinder aspect ratio. We can thus analyse axial and cross-sectional resistance separately, with the governing fluid equations reducing to axial Poiseuille flow and transverse Stokes flow, respectively. As our geometric parameter space is vast, we focus on three configurations (with fixed area) that have not been fully characterised in the literature: I) a circle in an ellipse, II) an ellipse in a circle, and III) an ellipse in an ellipse of equal eccentricity and orientation. In the case of axial resistance, we identify geometries that minimise resistance (or equivalently maximise flux for a given pressure drop) for each of the three reduced parameter spaces I), II), and III), uncovering the possibility of an optimal non-circular configuration. We then consider the full geometric parameter space, and determine the overall optimal geometry. Cross-sectional resistance can be characterised via coecients in a Stokes resistance matrix, and we again highlight non-monotonic effects of elliptical eccentricity."
